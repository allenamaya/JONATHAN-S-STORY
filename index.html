		<h1>The Attack</h1>
		<p>Jonathan had always loved fashion. As a boy growing up in South C Nairobi, he would spend hours drawing designs and dreaming of becoming a fashion designer. So when he was accepted into a prestigious fashion school in the city, he was over the moon.</p>
		<p>But one day, as he was walking to class, he saw a group of protestors up ahead. They were blocking the road and chanting slogans, waving placards and shouting at the top of their lungs. Jonathan tried to walk around them, but they spotted him and started to move towards him.</p>
		<p>He tried to explain that he was just a student, on his way to fashion school, but they didn't listen. They pushed him around, jeering and taunting him, until one of them pulled out a knife. Jonathan ran, as fast as he could, but they caught up with him and attacked him from behind.</p>
		<p>He woke up in hospital, his body battered and bruised. He couldn't walk, couldn't use his hands, couldn't even draw. He was devastated. His dreams, his future, had been taken away from him in an instant.</p>
		<p>But Jonathan was not one to give up easily. He started to work with a physical therapist, rebuilding his strength and learning how to use his hands again. And slowly, but surely, he started to draw again. His designs were different now, darker, more powerful. They spoke of the struggle, of the pain, of the resilience of the human spirit.</p>
		<p>And one day, he got a call from a fashion house in Paris. They had seen his designs online and they were interested in working with him. Jonathan couldn't believe it. He had never imagined that his work would be recognized, let alone celebrated, on the world stage.</p>
		<p>He traveled to Paris, nervous and excited, and presented his designs to the team. They were blown away. They had never seen anything like it. They offered him a job on the spot, and Jonathan accepted, tears streaming down his face.</p>
		<p>As he sat on the plane back to Nairobi, Jonathan thought about everything that had happened to him. The attack, the pain, the struggle. But also the resilience, the determination, the creativity. He knew that he had been through something terrible, but he also knew that it had made him stronger. And he was ready to take on the world.</p>
